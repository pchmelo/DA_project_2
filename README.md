## 2nd Year - 2nd Semester - 1st Group Project

### Brief description:

In this first programming project assignment, you are asked to implement an analysis tool that can support
the Management Team of a water supply network in Portugal to make informed decisions about how to
best allocate its resources, both financial as well as physical (e.g., procurement of new pumping stations or
installing new pipelines). Such a tool will allow management to decide on aspects such as how to best assign
selected pumping stations to supply sources and how to identify more sensitive sections of its network to
failures to anticipate service disruption or at least to mitigate its nefarious effects.
